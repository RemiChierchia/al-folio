I spent the last year of my Master's degree in Sweden.
I chose this destination because I was fed up with spending my time as a student in Trento (Italy). The matter is not Trento, but the fact that by 2021, I had already spent 4 years of my life and felt compelled to broaden my experience.

Thanks to my faculty (University of Trento) and my course, I learned about EIT, a European organisation whose goal is to provide tech students with ICT innovation skills useful in launching a start-up. So I decided to enrol in one of their joint programmes, which allowed me to move to Sweden.

### Why am I writing about this?
I had a fantastic time studying in another country and learning about different education systems and cultures in general. I never had really clear in mind what to do after graduation, but I was telling myself "you will figure it out". Until I started my internship, which inspired me to pursue a PhD as my next step.

### The discovery process
I recently finished my Master of Visual Computing Communication at KTH, but I am dissatisfied with the depth of information provided by this degree. My programme also had an emphasis on ICT Innovation, which was intended to bring engineering students closer to concepts like entrepreneurship. 
What I learnt from the latter was primarily about how to operate in a team and in a shared working and studying environment, which seemed insignificant at the time but culminated in a suitable skill. However, I found my Master's Degree to be just a touch more detailed than my Bachelor's.

I realised that, while a Master's can teach you a wide variety of knowledge, at the end of the day, I cannot bring specific knowledge with me.
#### The internship experience
I began my thesis in a company in Stockholm. Not much time after, I realised that job opportunities in a field like Computer Vision are primarily reliant on software programming. Despite my application to the research and development department, the productive coding skill remained dominant. 

I couldn't envision myself in that job at the time, and more crucially, I realised how much of the thinking process in my thesis was confined by the supervisors.
I found myself working in the direction that my superiors intended, although I was supposed to be in charge of the research question's development process. This made me feel as if I couldn't move in the way that seemed more reasonable to me, and I found that quite restrictive, and it caused me to lose some desire in pursuing that project. 

I then realised that my interest in learning new and challenging approaches was greater than my educational background had led me to assume.

### Conclusions
This experience made me realise that often I restrict myself from thinking that I could do more than what I am doing. 
I was accepted for a Master's degree with EIT (for which I also received a scholarship) and, more recently, for a PhD programme in Australia (QUT & CSIRO).
I learnt that being confident in myself and looking forward to new challenges is essential for progress.
